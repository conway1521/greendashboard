# Green Job Transformation Readiness dashboard

### Abstract
A comprehensive guide I developed for Jobs for the Future (JFF) aimed at empowering leaders to navigate the multifaceted challenges of fostering a vibrant green economy in the United States. As part of our Climate-Resilient Employees for a Sustainable Tomorrow (CREST) initiative (within JFFLabs’ Climate Innovation incubation practice area), our mission was to provide actionable insights grounded in data-driven analysis, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning to drive sustainable economic growth and resilience.

I used Python for cleaning and visualising the data, performing exploratory analysis and factor analysis. I then used Domo (like Tableau) for presenting and hosting my findings on JFF's website, which you can find [here](https://info.jff.org/assessing-regional-readiness-for-action).

### More Detail
The project addressed the pressing need for guidance amidst the increasing urgency to transition towards a more environmentally sustainable and economically viable future. With my expertise in data analytics and machine learning, I led the effort to analyse county-level data encompassing various dimensions of economic, social, and climate resilience. This involved delving into diverse data sources, including U.S. census records, climate observations, job market trends, and community surveys, to derive meaningful insights.

Utilising machine learning, I identified key variables influencing each dimension and developed a comprehensive framework to assess risk and readiness levels across different regions. Through meticulous analysis and interpretation of the data, I categorised regions by their unique challenges and opportunities and connected each type with extensive filed-derived qualitative insights from my teammates.

Finally, through the development of user-friendly, interactive data visualisation tools, I enabled stakeholders to explore and understand the findings intuitively. By creating interactive maps, charts, and graphs, we provide stakeholders with dynamic visual representations of complex data, facilitating deeper insights and informed decision-making.

Bringing these elements together, our guide serves as a unique and action-oriented resource where leaders across various sectors – including business, government, education, and community organising – engaged in climate change mitigation and green economic development efforts can go for insights and guidance. By offering tailored recommendations and actionable insights at the county level, we empower leaders to prioritise initiatives and allocate resources effectively.

Furthermore, our approach fosters collaboration and partnership-building by identifying regions with similar strengths or challenges, facilitating knowledge-sharing and collective action. By providing a roadmap for regional leaders to articulate their readiness and take proactive steps towards building a greener economy, we help lay the foundation for a more sustainable and resilient future.
